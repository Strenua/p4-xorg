## OverlayDepth is a 32-bit integer which is used to control overlay
## stacking order.  The overlay with the lowest depth is in front of
## all others.  This value has meaning only when multiple overlays are
## present on a display.

#
## ARGBHWCursor controls whether the X driver uses an overlay to
## display 32-bit "true-color" cursors, or whether such cursors are
## emulated in software.  Valid values are "true" to enable hardware
## cursors, and "false" (default) to disable them.
